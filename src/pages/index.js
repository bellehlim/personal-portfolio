              I'm currently a student at Northeastern University studying computer science with a concentration in human-centered computing and a 
              minor in experience design. I am passionate about building polished products end-to-end that prioritize the user
              <br/><br/>
              When I'm not in front of my laptop, you can find me wandering around Boston or New York exploring the cities, bouldering, hanging out 
              with my dog, or cooking! (Check out my food IG @yummyinmybelley!)
